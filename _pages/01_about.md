Hi! My name is Andrew Crossman. Born in Maryland and raised in Delaware, I've spent my life thus far plastered to the East Mid-Atlantic.I graduated from William Penn High School in 2015 and attended the University of Delaware right after. From there I graduated with an Honors Bachelor's Degree of Science in Physics with Minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. Aside from learning, I spent much of my free time developing my coding skills (hence this website) and participating in the Student Physics Society (SPS) and Young Progressives Demanding Action (YPDA). I also worked as an Undergradauted Researcher in the Physics deparment under [Thomas Gaisser](https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/thomas-gaisser/) as a part of The ICECUBE SouthPole Neutrino Observatory. My work mainly dealt with processing, extrapolating, and interpreting large amounts of data and then creating user friendly graphics to present the findings. Some of my work can be seen in my co-authored paper [Precision of analytical approximations in calculations of Atmospheric Leptons](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08676)
