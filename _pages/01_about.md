Hi, my name is Andrew Crossman and I am an experimental Physicist with a focus in Condensed Matter. 

## Education
I graduated with an Honors Bachelor's Degree of Science in Physics with Minors in Mathematics and Computer Science from the Univeristy of Delaware in the spring of 2019. During my undergraduate years I worked as a Researcher in the Department of Physics and Astronomy under [Thomas Gaisser](https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/thomas-gaisser/) as a part of The ICECUBE SouthPole Neutrino Observatory group. My work mainly dealt with processing, extrapolating, and interpreting bulk data with an emphasis in generating user friendly visuals that could be presented at weekly meetings to discuss my findings. Some of my work can be seen in my co-authored paper [Precision of analytical approximations in calculations of Atmospheric Leptons](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08676). In addition to my work as a researcher, I spent much of my free time developing my coding skills (hence this website) and participating in the Student Physics Society (SPS).

After taking a gap year, I returned to the University of Delaware to continue my education in Physics. Currently, I am three years in to earning my Ph.D in Physics with a focus in Condensed Matter under my advisors [Karl Unruh](https://web.physics.udel.edu/people/kmu) and [Matthew DeCamp](https://web.physics.udel.edu/people/mdecamp). As a graduate student, I work as both an Assistant Proffesor and Researcher. My responsibilities as an Assistant Proffesor include leading discussions and/or labs for the introductory level undergraduate students as well as developing the courses and lesson plans. On the Researcher side of things, my responsibilites revolve around developing and performing computational and physical experiments. This includes everything from writing code in Fortran 95 and Python, to chemically synthesizing samples, to operating x-ray diffraction machines - just to name a few things. My current research work is on maturing science's understanding of diffusion on the nanoscale. This is important work because the performance of a huge variety of catalytic, electronic, magnetic, and optical products and devices depend on maintaining their desirable properties throughout the manufacturing process (often at elevated temperatures) and subsequent use over extended periods of time. Some of this work can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AndrewCrossman).

## Interests
* __Computer Hardware__ - There are few moments more exciting than rigging a dozen very expensive and very delicate computer components together and finding out that everything is operating according to plan. A lot of care and effort has to go into ensuring that all the different parts will function and fit together. You have to check the brand, the manufacturer, the part number, etc. against every other piece or risk losing a lot of money when something inevitably goes wrong. But, the low hum of the tower fans accompanied by a crisp clear image on the monitor is super worth it. 
* __Stock Analysis__ - Everyone likes making money but very few apply highly technical approaches through the stock market. Using python, I have developed [code](https://github.com/AndrewCrossman/Other) that considers a securityâ€™s Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD and Signal, EMAs, and SMAs in order to make informed purchasing decisions. My favorites securities are MSFT, TSM, and NVDA.
* __Dancing__ - When I am not exercising my mind, I like to exercise my body. Specifically, through dance. In the past I worked a lot on BHopping but now I prefer more relaxing dances like Cumbia, Bachata, and Merengue.
